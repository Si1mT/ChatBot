# ChatBot

A chat bot built using a [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grafstor/simple-dialogs-for-chatbot). The dataset has questions or prompts in the first column and answers in the second column. After we've tried out various algorithms to make the model for the bot and determined which one is the best, we'll generate data using another chat bot and see if it improves the quality of our own bot.
